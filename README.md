# Myocarditis-prediction-in-Covid-19-patient-using-machine-learning-algorithm
Myocarditis, one of the great consequence of
Covid-19 due to which many people got affected and loss their
life .Here a few data are available in the literature about the
incidence and clinical significance in patients affected by
SARS-CoV-2. Myocarditis occurs when the heart muscle
becomes inflamed and inflammation occurs when your body’s
immune system responds to infections . It can be diagnosed
using cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI), a non-invasive
imaging technique with the possibility of operator bias. This
paper proposes different machine learning algorithms to detect
myocarditis . We evaluate our proposed approach on the
“Characterization of Myocardial Injury in Patients With
COVID-19" myocarditis dataset based on standard criteria and
demonstrate that the proposed method gives superior
myocarditis diagnosis performanc Further studies, specifically
designed on this issue, are warranted.
